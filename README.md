# ImageCloak: Deep Learning-Based Image Steganography System
ImageCloak is an advanced image steganography web application that enables users to securely embed and extract hidden text or images within digital images using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Designed for secure communication, it preserves the visual integrity of the cover image while ensuring high imperceptibility and robustness.

# üîê Features
User Authentication
Secure Login & Registration: JWT-based authentication to manage user sessions and access controls.

Steganography Capabilities
Text and Image Embedding: Hide secret text or image within a cover image using CNNs.

Data Extraction: Accurately decode the hidden content from stego-images.

Encryption Support: Secure the embedded data with a stego-key before hiding.

File Management
MongoDB Integration: Efficient storage and retrieval of user data and stego-images.

Image Upload & Sharing: Users can upload cover/secret images and share encoded images securely.

Communication
Contact Management: Add trusted contacts for secure file exchanges.

Secure Sharing: Encrypted and validated file transmission between users.

Robust Architecture
MERN Stack: Built using MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js for high performance and scalability.

Model Integration: Deep learning models trained in TensorFlow and served via Flask API.

# üß† Technology Stack
